# Bernie Auth - Front end **!!WIP!!**

## Description

This is the front end for the Bernie Auth project. It is a simple web app that allows users to register and login to the Bernie Auth service.
Also it allows users to create and manage their own organizations and clients to use the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect services provided by the Bernie Auth service.
