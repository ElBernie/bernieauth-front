# Bernie Auth - Front end **!!WIP!!**

## Description

This is the front end for the Bernie Auth project. It is a simple web app that allows users to register and login to the Bernie Auth service.
Also it allows users to create and manage their own organizations and clients to use the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect services provided by the Bernie Auth service.

## Experimental

This project is experimental and is not intended for production use. It is a playground for me to test new technologies and ideas, so it is subject to change at any time.

## Stack

- Typescript
- React
- Vite
- [@tanstack/router](https://tanstack.com/)

### planned stack

- [@tanstack/query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- tailwindcss
- redux: not sure about it, I'll have to investigate about the @tanstack/query state capabilities before.

## Notes

You can find my personal notes about this project in the [docs/NOTES.md](docs/NOTES.md) file. Also contains knowns bugs.
